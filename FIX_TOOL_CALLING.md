# Test if MCP tools are actually being called

## The Problem:
Your AI is explaining HOW to do things instead of DOING them.

## Quick Test Commands:

### 1. Very Direct Tool Call:
"Use the write_file tool from filesystem MCP to create a file at /workspace/test.txt with content 'Hello MCP'"

### 2. Even More Direct:
"Call function: write_file
Parameters: 
- path: /workspace/test.txt
- content: Hello from MCP tools"

### 3. Alternative Phrasing:
"I need you to actually execute the write_file function, not explain how to do it. Create /workspace/hello.py"

## If Tools Still Don't Execute:

### Check Tool Configuration:
1. In Available Tools panel, are the tools showing as "enabled" or just "available"?
2. Is there a checkbox or toggle to activate them?
3. Are they set as "Global" tools or just "User" tools?

### Try Different Models:
Some models handle tool calling better:
- GPT-4: Excellent tool calling
- Claude: Excellent tool calling  
- Gemini: Sometimes needs specific prompting
- Local models: Variable support

### Check OpenWebUI Version:
```bash
docker exec local-open-webui cat /app/package.json | grep version
```

Older versions might not support tool calling properly.

## The Nuclear Option: Use a Tool-Calling Model

If Gemini won't call tools, try adding GPT-3.5-turbo which has better tool support:

1. Add OpenAI connection:
   - Settings → Connections → Add
   - Base URL: https://api.openai.com/v1
   - API Key: Your OpenAI key

2. Test with GPT-3.5:
   - It should actually EXECUTE tools, not explain them
