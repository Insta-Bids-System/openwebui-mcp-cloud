# ðŸš¨ Git Push Blocked - GitHub Secret Protection

GitHub is blocking our push because it detected what looks like a GitHub token in commit `58a9508`. This is actually just a placeholder token, not a real one.

## Options to Fix This:

### Option 1: Allow This Specific Token (Quickest)
Since it's just a placeholder token (`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`), you can:
1. Visit this URL: https://github.com/Insta-Bids-System/openwebui-mcp-cloud/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2zgnrjEHp1qhLhNfbPax7ssK2Zb
2. Allow this specific token to be pushed
3. Then retry: `git push cloud Aditya`

### Option 2: Remove the Token from History (Cleaner)
This requires rewriting git history:
```bash
# Interactive rebase to edit the problematic commit
git rebase -i 58a9508^

# Mark the commit for edit, then:
git commit --amend
# Remove the token references
git rebase --continue

# Force push (requires force push permissions)
git push cloud Aditya --force
```

### Option 3: Create a New Branch (Safest)
Start fresh without the problematic commits:
```bash
# Create new branch from before the issue
git checkout -b Aditya-clean 327003e
# Cherry-pick the good commits
git cherry-pick e59513f
git cherry-pick 11e9165
# Push the clean branch
git push cloud Aditya-clean
```

## Recommendation

Since this is just a placeholder token and not a real secret, **Option 1** is the quickest. Just visit the URL and allow this specific "secret" to be pushed.

The token `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` is:
- Not a real GitHub token
- Used only as a placeholder in documentation
- Safe to allow in the repository

After allowing it, all future pushes will work normally.
