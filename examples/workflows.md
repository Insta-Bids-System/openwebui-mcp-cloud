## üìö Best Practices

### Tool Selection Guidelines
```yaml
desktop-commander:
  use_for:
    - Local development
    - Running tests
    - File manipulation
    - Build processes
  
github:
  use_for:
    - Version control
    - Code review (PRs)
    - CI/CD configuration
    - Issue tracking
  
droplet-executor:
  use_for:
    - Production operations
    - Deployment
    - Monitoring
    - Infrastructure management
```

### Workflow Optimization Tips

1. **Parallel Execution**: When possible, run independent tasks simultaneously
2. **Fail-Fast**: Detect issues early in the workflow
3. **Rollback Ready**: Always have a rollback plan
4. **Monitoring**: Add observability to every workflow
5. **Documentation**: Update docs as part of the workflow

### Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets (use environment variables)
- Always test in staging before production
- Implement proper access controls
- Audit all automated actions
- Use least-privilege principles

## üéØ Conclusion

These workflows demonstrate how MCP tools can work together to create powerful automation for real-world development scenarios. The key is treating the tools as a unified system rather than isolated components.

### Next Steps
1. Customize these workflows for your team
2. Create workflow templates
3. Build a workflow library
4. Share successful patterns

Remember: The best workflow is one that your team will actually use! Start simple and iterate based on real needs.
